This is how Dark Souls Three formulates total weapon damage EXPLAINED (The majority of this information was not given and had to be calculated)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each weapon has two different types of damage numbers, base damage and bonus damage. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Base Damage:
This is very straightforward and easily obtainable. Every weapon has base damage and this can be increased depending on how many times you upgrade a weapon. There are no calculations needed this value is just given.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bonus Damage:
Every weapon has at least one of the four different types of scalings; strength, dexterity, intelligence, and faith. These values are responsible for how much bonus damage you will receive. However, these scaling values are represented as a range of values, these ranges can be distinguished by a letter variable. Here are the ranges:

S: 141% ≤ S
A: 101% ≤ A < 141%
B: 81% ≤ B < 101%
C: 51% ≤ C < 81%
D: 21% ≤ D < 50%
E: 0% < E < 21%

Depending on what scaling letter is shown (I will be referring to this letter value as weapon mod from now on) and what character stat level you have is how much bonus damage you do S being the best and E being the worst. 
(If you have a weapon that only scales with strength, it will not matter how many levels you put into dexterity, the bonus damage on the weapon will remain the same)

Saturation Value:
Still, on the topic of bonus damage, there is something we need to talk about. The letter values are correlated to the level number of your character's specific attribute. To fully calculate the bonus damage you need the base damage multiplied by the sum of the weapon mod and saturation value. The saturation value represents a percent value from 0%-100%. At 100% you can use the weapons full damage and there will be no penalty or damage nerf also known as the saturation value. To reach 100% you must level up the character attribute to 99 which is the max level. In theory, you would think if you are level 50 then you will have a 50% saturation level, sadly that is wrong.

To find the correct saturation value you must find which of the 16 graphs are used for which type of scaling. (The majority of weapons use graph 0 to find the saturation.) Each graph follows a square root graph, As the attribute level increases the saturation value will as well, however, at a certain level you will start to receive diminishing returns. This is called a soft cap. there is also something called a hard cap where you will receive even greater diminishing returns. For the four attributes discussed above (strength, dexterity, intelligence, and faith) their soft cap is around level 40, and hard cap at 60.
